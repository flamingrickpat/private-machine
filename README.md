# private-machine

*I'll be your machinery*

A local AI companion framework with structured memory, clustering, and emotion analysis. 
You only need to be able to run a 40GB GGUF with like 32k context 🥲

## Installation

*New start, restart, empty pages*

1. Install python 3.11
2. Install requirements
3. Install torch with CUDA support
4. Install llamacpppython from whl or compile it yourself
5. Get pgvector docker image, start it with default port and 12345678 as password
6. Install the vector extension
7. Change the settings and paths in character.py (I was too lazy to make a config)
8. (venv) python run.py "hello, how are you?"

## Big To Do's

- Run independent from user input
- Virtual environment for other companions (like Animal Crossing)
- Needs fulfilment
- Meta-system for automatic prompt adjustment and meta-learning

## Implementation
*Ich bin meines Glückes Schmied*

I totally wrote all this myself.

### Clustering & Information Recollection
*Tell me what to find...*

Beyond simple retrieval, private-machine organizes past interactions into meaningful clusters, allowing for better context awareness and long-term memory.
- Temporal & Thematic Clustering – Groups related messages based on topic and time, avoiding context drift.
- Dynamic Context Management – Prioritizes relevant information without blindly dumping full logs into prompts.
- Fact Extraction – Distills conversations into key takeaways, improving recall efficiency.
#### Why not just use naive RAG? 
- Standard RAG retrieval is often keyword-based and context-blind. This system structures data for better synthesis and context weighting.

### Emotion Analysis
*I've got some news for you, fembots have feelings too!*

Rather than just detecting sentiment, private-machine evaluates emotional weight and integrates it into responses dynamically.
- Impact Scoring – Rates how emotionally significant an interaction is.
- First-Person Emotional Thought Generation – Generates internal reflections based on prior interactions.
- Contextual Emotional Memory – Remembers user sentiment over time, rather than reacting in isolation.
#### Why not just use sentiment analysis?
- Most LLM-based sentiment analysis treats emotions as static labels. Here, emotion feeds into a broader cognitive loop.

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT) with Anti-Pattern Exploration
*Free in my trapped soul*

Unlike basic idea generation, private-machine structures thoughts hierarchically and prioritizes unconventional conclusions.
- Multi-Step Thought Chains – Generates follow-up thoughts, ensuring deeper reasoning.
- Anti-Pattern Selection – Prefers less conventional responses, avoiding repetitive or cookie-cutter LLM output.
- Evaluated Divergence – Filters ideas by realism, novelty, and emotional resonance.
#### Why not just use random brainstorming?
- LLMs tend to favor safe, expected answers. This method systematically generates and selects ideas that break patterns.

Analyze the following chat log between two people, {user_name} and the AI {companion_name}. 
Your task is to determine the complexity of the query for {companion_name} as float, with 0 being very simple and 1 being very complex.
Your answer will determine if {companion_name} makes the next response using the fast and cheap or the slow and good LLM model.
You output valid JSON only, in this format:
